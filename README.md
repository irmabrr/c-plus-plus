# C++

This repository is my personal C++ learning journal — a space where I document my progress and build small projects as I strengthen my understanding of the language and its core concepts.

# What You'll Find Here: 
- Beginner-friendly C++ programs
- Practice exercises and mini-projects
- Notes and examples on core topics

# Purpose:
This repo helps me:
- Track my learning journey
- Practice writing clean, efficient C++ code
- Build a foundation for future, more advanced projects

# How to Run:
If you’d like to run any of the files:

```cpp
//on codecademy
g++ filename.cpp
./a.out
```

# Topics Covered So Far:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if/else, loops)
- Vectors 
- Coming soon!:
    - Functions
    - Arrays and Strings
    - Object-Oriented Programming 

# Future Goals:
- Begin to start solving easy leetcodes 
- Have a simple project to show my C++ knowledge
